# Project Rules for Claude Code

## Code Quality Workflow

After making any code changes, always run these commands in order:

1. `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
2. `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint issues
3. `npm run lint` - Check for remaining lint errors

Report any linting errors or warnings that cannot be auto-fixed.

## Development Standards

- Follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Use TypeScript strict mode - always type your code properly
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Use the `@/*` path alias for imports from `src/`
- Place components in `src/app/` following App Router structure
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Prefer server components by default; use "use client" only when necessary

## Code Style

- Double quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- 2-space indentation
- 80 character line width
- ES5 trailing commas

## Git Commits

- Pre-commit hooks will automatically format and lint staged files
- Ensure all changes pass linting before committing
