## üìã Sections to Refine

### Template for Each Section

For each remaining page/section, follow this process:

#### **Step 1: Visual Audit**

```
Navigate to /[page-route] using Playwright and take a screenshot.

Analyze:
- Current layout and structure
- Visual hierarchy
- Component usage
- Spacing and alignment
- User flow and interactions
- Accessibility considerations
- Areas needing improvement

Compare with our established design system.
```

#### **Step 2: Apply Improvements**

```
Improve the [page-name] page with:

Design Consistency:
- Apply shadcn styling patterns matching our global components
- Use colors from our defined palette
- Follow established spacing and typography hierarchy
- Ensure consistent component variants

UX Enhancements:
- Clear visual hierarchy for key information
- Intuitive navigation and user flow
- Proper loading and error states
- Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Responsive behavior across breakpoints

Specific to this page:
- [List page-specific requirements]
- [Any unique features or interactions]
- [Data display or form needs]
```

#### **Step 3: Test Interactions**

```
Use Playwright to test key interactions on /[page-route]:
- [Primary user action 1]
- [Primary user action 2]
- [Form submission / data loading / etc.]
- [Error handling]
- Screenshot each state (default, hover, active, error, success)
- Test responsive behavior (desktop, tablet, mobile)
```

#### **Step 4: Iterate**

```
[Based on screenshot feedback, make specific adjustments]

Examples:
- "The spacing between cards needs to be more consistent"
- "Add a loading skeleton for the data table"
- "Improve the empty state illustration"
- "Make the CTA button more prominent"
```

#### **Step 5: Document Changes**

After completing the page, note:

- ‚úÖ Components used
- ‚úÖ New patterns introduced
- ‚úÖ Any deviations from design system (and why)
- ‚úÖ Outstanding issues or future improvements
